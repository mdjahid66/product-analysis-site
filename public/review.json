I can smell the vanilla and honey as distinct, independent scents; yet they also blend into a soothing aroma. From a design standpoint, I think the tall, slender, square-ish shape is beautiful. The lid is wood; I use mine as a platform to place my candle. And as always, this Yankee Candle burns even and lasts for a long time.",
